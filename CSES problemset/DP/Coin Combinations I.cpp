/*Consider a money system consisting of n coins. Each coin has a positive integer value. Your 
task is to calculate the number of distinct ways you can produce a money sum x using the available coins.

For example, if the coins are {2,3,5} and the desired sum is 9, there are 8 ways:
2+2+5
2+5+2
5+2+2
3+3+3
2+2+2+3
2+2+3+2
2+3+2+2
3+2+2+2
Input

The first input line has two integers n and x: the number of coins and the desired sum of money.

The second line has n distinct integers c1,c2,…,cn: the value of each coin.

Output

Print one integer: the number of ways modulo 109+7.

Constraints
1≤n≤100
1≤x≤106
1≤ci≤106
Example

Input:
3 9
2 3 5

Output:
8*/
