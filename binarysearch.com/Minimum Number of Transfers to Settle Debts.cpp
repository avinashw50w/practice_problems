/*You are given a two-dimensional list of integers transfers containing [source, dest, amount], 
which means that person source lent person dest a dollar amount equal to amount. Return the 
minimum number of person-to-person transfers that are required so that all debts are paid.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 13 where n is the number of participants
Example 1
Input
transfers = [
    [0, 1, 50],
    [1, 2, 50]
]
Output
1
Explanation
Person 0 gave person 1 $50 and person 1 gave person 2 $50.
So person 2 can directly give $50 to person 0.

IDEA: store the debts of each person and do backtracking to resolve the debts to 0
in the eg. above, the debts of all the persons 0, 1 and 2 are:
0 : -50
1 : 50   
1 : -50 
2 : 50
overall 0 : -50, 1: 0, 2: 50
