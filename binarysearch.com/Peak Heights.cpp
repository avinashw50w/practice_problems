/*You are given a two-dimensional integer matrix containing 0s and 1s where 0 represents water 
and 1 represents land. Return a new matrix of the same dimensions where we increase the height 
of every land cell as much as possible given that:

The height of any water cell stays 0
Any cell can differ by at most 1 unit of height between neighboring cells (up, down, left, right)
You can assume there is at least one water cell.

Constraints

n, m â‰¤ 250 where n and m are the number of rows and columns in matrix
Example 1
Input
matrix = [
    [0, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1]
]
Output
[
    [0, 1, 0],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 3, 2]
]

IDEA: use multi-source bfs. 
take all 0's as the source and insert them into queue. Then do a bfs
On first encountering a 1, update its distance*/
