1. nth Highest Salary
SELECT min(Salary) FROM Employee WHERE Employee IN
(SELECT DISTINCT TOP n Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC)

Question 1: SQL Query to find second highest salary of Employee
Answer: There are many ways to find second highest salary of Employee in SQL, 
you can either use SQL Join or Subquery to solve this problem. Here is SQL query using Subquery:

select MAX(Salary) from Employee WHERE Salary NOT IN (select MAX(Salary) from Employee ); 


Question 2: SQL Query to find Max Salary from each department.
Answer: You can find the maximum salary for each department by grouping all records by DeptId and then using MAX() function to calculate maximum salary in each group or each department.

SELECT DeptID, MAX(Salary) FROM Employee  GROUP BY DeptID. 

These questions become more interesting if Interviewer will ask you to print department name instead of department id, in that case, you need to join Employee table with Department using foreign key DeptID, make sure you do LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN to include departments without any employee as well.  Here is the query

SELECT DeptName, MAX(Salary) FROM Employee e RIGHT JOIN Department d ON e.DeptId = d.DeptID GROUP BY DeptName;

In this query, we have used RIGHT OUTER JOIN because we need the name of the department from Department table which is on the right side of JOIN clause, even if there is no reference of dept_id on Employee table.

Question 11: Write SQL Query to find duplicate rows in a database? and then write SQL query to delete them?
Answer: You can use the following query to select distinct records:
SELECT * FROM emp a WHERE rowid = (SELECT MAX(rowid) FROM EMP b WHERE a.empno=b.empno)

to Delete:
DELETE FROM emp a WHERE rowid != (SELECT MAX(rowid) FROM emp b WHERE a.empno=b.empno);


Question 12: There is a table which contains two column Student and Marks, you need to find all the students, whose marks are greater than average marks i.e. list of above average students.
Answer: This query can be written using subquery as shown below:
SELECT student, marks from table where marks > SELECT AVG(marks) from table)


/*copy the structure of a table to a new table that you are going to create*/
create table <newTable> select * from <oldTable> where 1 = 2;

/*change the format of dates in a column to another format */

UPDATE `table` SET `fieldname` = DATE_FORMAT(str_to_date(fieldname, 'old_format'), 'new_format'); 

eg: update users set created = date_format(str_to_date(created, '%d/%m/%Y %H:%i'), '%m/%d/%Y %h:%i:%s %p'); 
NOTE: the default date format in sql table is Y-m-d H:i:s
